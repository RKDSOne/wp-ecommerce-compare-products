==Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 
When can I use this plugin? =

You can use this plugin when you have installed the WP e-Commerce plugin

= 
How do I show the Compare button on product page and detail product page? =

You can go to Products -> Compare Settings, checked on Auto Add Compare button, it will automatically add the Compare button on your theme. If you want to show the Compare button anywhere you want, you unchecked Auto Add Compare button, then copy this code `<? if(function_exists('wpec_add_compare_button')) echo wpec_add_compare_button(); ?>` and past into the theme code where you want to show Compare button.

= 

How do I change the Color of the Compare Buttons to match my theme? = 

It is an easy task to change the color of the button - but you will need some coding knowledge.

All objects in the plugin have a class so you can style for them. Using an ftp client open the style.css in your theme.

Look for the style of your themes buttons below is an example - it will look something like this
wrap input[type="submit"], #wrap input[type="button"] {

background: url('images/bg-button.png') no-repeat scroll right top transparent; border: 1px solid #153B94; border-radius: 5px 5px 5px 5px; box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #333333; color: #FFFFFF; cursor: pointer; font-size: 12px; padding: 9px 27px 7px 10px; }

Once you have found that in themes style.css directory then add that style into your themes style.css under the class name 'bt_compare_this' which is for the Compare button on the product pages and class name 'compare_button_go' for the Compare button in the sidebar widget. This is how it would look using the example above as the style for the button.

input.bt_compare_this { background: url('images/bg-button.png') no-repeat scroll right top transparent; border: 1px solid #153B94; border-radius: 5px 5px 5px 5px; box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #333333; color: #FFFFFF; cursor: pointer; font-size: 12px; padding: 9px 27px 7px 10px; }

This will then mean that style will apply for all input tag in div that has the class compare_button_container to change the sidebar widget button you do the same but use the class 'compare_button_go'

=

How can I auto show the Compare Featured fields on my product pages? =

You can copy this code `<? if(function_exists('wpec_show_compare_fields')) echo wpec_show_compare_fields(); ?>` and past into your theme code where you want to show the Compare Featured fields to auto show on your product pages.
