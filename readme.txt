== Description ==


WP eCommerce Compare Products is designed to give shoppers on your site the ultimate in shopping comparison features to make choosing and buying a product from your offering a breeze.

WP eCommerce Compare Products adds a product Comparison feature to any or all products on your WPEC site. Site users click a button or a link to add products to their compare list in the sidebar widget area. 

Once products are added to the Compare sidebar widget users click the Compare button and the products they have added show side-by-side with all features in a beautiful mac like pop up screen.

From the pop up screen they can add products to their shpping cart, print the results or return to the product page and continue to add other products.
